        A Fireside Chat with Ed Catmull
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Ed Catmull proposed three ideas that transformed computer graphics fundamentally
        during his graduate
        student life at University of Utah: texture mapping, depth buffering, and subdivision surfaces. He also made
        real time, realistic animation as his mission through his time in NYIT, Lucasfilms, ILM, Pixar, and Walt Disney
        Animation Studios. It is not an exaggeration to state that his work touches every rendered pixel that we see on
        screen. In a freewheeling chat, Dr Catmull discusses his experiences at graduate school, in NYIT, and how the
        practice of computer-generated animation has changed over the years. </p>

        Interdisciplinarity and Engineering: The Road Ahead
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The talk will begin with an appreciation of what engineering means for a society and
        how to measure it. We then present some data on how engineering fares in Indian society and problem areas. I
        argue that (i) better but applicable research (ii) and creating entry points for entrepreneurs, will improve
        social outcomes.

        But this needs a different interdisciplinary outlook and training in field work, documentation and analysis.
        Given our systems-approach, the CS-IT graduate is specially well-equipped to undertake such work.

        I will look at public transport as a sector and illustrate this approach. We will first see the broad
        significance of the sector. Next, we will look at the taluka bus depot as an enterprise and the data sets by
        which they operate. We will then show how the notion of a Digital Geography can improve the analysis of their
        operations. In the second part, we will look at the transport system from outside, i.e., the question of how
        well is the taluka Bus Depot serving society. We will take the example of school-going children and their
        transport needs and analyse how well they are being provided. This will need supplementing the Digital Geography
        with additional (and easily available) socio-economic datasets.

        Finally, we argue that such analysis and the use of local data is essential for the training of the new
        engineer. Such skills will prepare the engineer as a social change-agent and an entrepreneur, and not merely an
        employee.

        Almost Envy-Free Division of Indivisible Goods
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Fair division of indivisible goods is a basic problem in economics, law, computer
        science, and the social sciences. The goal is to distribute m goods to n agents in a fair manner. The goods are
        assumed to be indivisible. Every agent has a value (= a nonnegative number) for each subset of goods. In this
        setting, envy is unavoidable. Think of two agents and one good which both value. The agent that does not get the
        good will envy the agent that gets the good.
        The literature on fair division dates back more than 100 years. Fair division of divisible goods is also known
        as the cake-cutting problem.
        For this talk, fairness is envy-freeness up to any good (EFX). No agent should envy any other after the removal
        of any single good from the other agent’s bundle. It is not known whether or not such an allocation always
        exists. We survey results on fair division and sketch two results towards existence of EFX-allocations.

        1. For additive valuations and three agents EFX-allocations exist (Bhaskar Ray Chaudhury, Jugal Garg, and Kurt
        Mehlhorn: EFX Exists for Three Agents. In EC ’20, pages 1–19).
        2. There is always (Bhaskar Ray Chaudhury, Tellikepalli Kavitha, Kurt Mehlhorn, and Alkmini Sgouritsa: A Little
        Charity Guarantees Almost Envy-Freeness. In SODA ’20, pages 2658–2672) a partition of the good set X into n + 1
        subsets (X1, . . . , Xn, P) such that <br>
        • the allocation (X1, . . . , Xn) is EFX,<br>
        • no agent values P (= the goods donated to charity) higher than her own bundle, and<br>
        • fewer than n goods go to charity, i.e., |P| < n (typically m » n).<br>

        Our proofs are constructive.

        The role of massively parallel computing in personalized blood flow modeling
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The recognition of the role hemodynamic forces have in the localization and
        development of disease has motivated large-scale efforts to enable patient-specific simulations. When combined
        with computational approaches that can extend the models to include physiologically accurate hematocrit levels
        in large regions of the circulatory system, these image-based models yield insight into the underlying
        mechanisms driving disease progression and inform surgical planning or the design of next generation drug
        delivery systems. Building a detailed, realistic model of human blood flow, however, is a formidable
        mathematical and computational challenge. The models must incorporate the motion of fluid, intricate geometry of
        the blood vessels, continual pulse-driven changes in flow and pressure, and the behavior of suspended bodies
        such as red blood cells. In this talk, I will discuss the development of HARVEY, a parallel fluid dynamics
        application designed to model hemodynamics in patient-specific geometries. I will cover the methods introduced
        to reduce the overall time-to-solution and effectively leverage leadership class systems. Finally, I will
        discuss the role of personalized blood flow models for applications ranging from treatment planning for
        cardiovascular disease to studying cancer cell adhesion and metastatic progression.
